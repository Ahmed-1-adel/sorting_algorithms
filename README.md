Description
Fourth team project. Introduction to popular sorting algorithms, and using big O notation to indicate time and space complexity.

Note
This project was created in a repository separate from holbertonschool-low_level_programming, where the other projects from this section are located.

Requirements
You are not allowed to use global variables
Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, â€¦ is totally forbidden.
The following format is expected for big O notation:
O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n squared -> O(n^2)
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n \* log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
n + k -> O(n+k)
Please use the "short" notation (don't use constants). Example: O(nk) or O(wn) should be written O(n). If an answer is required within a file, all your answers files must have a newline at the end.

Provided file(s)
